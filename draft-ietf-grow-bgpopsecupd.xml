            <t>
                The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical component in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
                Due to this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability requirements that can and should be ensured to prevent accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
            </t>
            <t>
                Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described in RFC7454 / BCP194.
                Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194, several developments and changes in operational practice took place that warrant an update of these best current practices.
                This document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, focusing on the overall goals, and providing a less implementation centric set of best practices.
            </t>
            <t>
                To this end, the document describes the security requirements and goals when operating BGP for exchanging routing information with other networks.
                The document explicitly does not focus on specific technical implementations and requirements.
                Operators are advised to consult documentation and contemporary informational documents concerning methods to ensure that these properties are sufficiently ensured in their network.

            <t>
                The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), specified in <xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/>, is the protocol used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
                BGP does not directly include mechanisms that control whether the routes exchanged conform to the various guidelines defined by the Internet community.
                Furthermore, the BGP protocol itself, by its design, does not have any direct way to protect itself against threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
                This document summarizes security properties and requirements when operating BGP for securing the infrastructure as well as for security considerations regarding the exchanged routing information.

                The guidelines defined in this document are intended for BGP when used to exchange generic Internet routing information within the DFZ.
                It specifically does not cover other uses of BGP, e.g., when using BGP for NLRI exchange in a data-center context.
                This document does not specify how the outlined requirements and properties can be technically realized at a specific point in time.
                Instead, operators are advised to consult applicable documentation and contemporary informational documents describing implementation specifics.

                The BGP speaker, i.e., the host running BGP to exchange routing information, needs to be protected from external attempts to taint integrity or availability of the BGP session and host alike.

                The purpose of BGP is exchanging routing information, i.e., NLRI.
