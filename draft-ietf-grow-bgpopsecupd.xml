            <t>
                The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical component in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
                Due to this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability requirements that can and should be ensured to prevent accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
                This document describes security requirements and goals when operating BGP for exchanging routing information with other networks, and explicitly does not focus on specific technical implementations and requirements.

            <t>
                The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), specified in <xref target="RFC4271" format="default"/>, is the protocol used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
                BGP does not directly include mechanisms that control whether the routes exchanged conform to the various guidelines defined by the Internet community.
                Furthermore, the BGP protocol itself, by its design, does not have any direct way to protect itself against threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
            </t>
            <t>
                This document summarizes security properties and requirements when operating BGP for securing the infrastructure as well as for security considerations regarding the exchanged routing information.
                The document explicitly does not focus on specific technical implementations and requirements.
                Operators are advised to consult documentation and contemporary informational documents concerning methods to ensure that these properties are sufficiently ensured in their network.

            <t>
                The guidelines defined in this document are intended for BGP when used to exchange generic Internet routing information within the Default-Free Zone (DFZ).
                It specifically does not cover other uses of BGP, e.g., when using BGP for NLRI exchange in a data-center context.
                This document does not specify how the outlined requirements and properties can be technically realized at a specific point in time.
                Instead, operators are advised to consult applicable documentation and contemporary informational documents describing implementation specifics (e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-routing-ops-sec-inform" format="default"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-routing-ops-terms" format="default"/>).

            <t>
                The BGP speaker, i.e., the node running BGP to exchange routing information, needs to be protected from external attempts to taint integrity or availability of the BGP session and node alike.

                <t>
                    To protect a BGP speaker on the network layer, an operator <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ensure the following properties using technical or organizational measures:

                    <li>
                        Prevent remote systems from overwhelming the BGP speaker by sending large volumes of unsolicited packets or BGP messages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that unstable sessions do not threaten the availability of BGP speakers within the network.

                    Example technologies to accomplish this include GTSM/TTL-security <xref target="RFC5082" format="default"/>, BGP-MD5 / TCP-AO <xref target="RFC5925" format="default"/>, limiting traffic to the control plane via Control Plane Policing (CoPP), and setting maximum prefix limits for the number of prefixes a neighbor may send.

                    <li>
                        External activity towards the management interface does not interfere with the integrity or availability of BGP sessions.

                Importing or exporting incorrect or malicious NLRI is a security risk for networks themselves, but may also form a threat for connected and/or remote networks.
