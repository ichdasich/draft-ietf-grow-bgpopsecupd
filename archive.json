      "body": "```\r\n# 1.  Introduction\r\n# \r\n#    The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), specified in [RFC4271], is the\r\n#    protocol used in the Internet to exchange routing information between\r\n#    network domains.  BGP does not directly include mechanisms that\r\n#    control whether the routes exchanged conform to the various\r\n#    guidelines defined by the Internet community.\r\n\r\nADD HERE:\r\n\r\nBesides, BGP by its design does not have any direct way to protect itself\r\nagainst possible security-related threats.\r\n\r\n#  This document intends\r\n#    to both summarize common existing guidelines and help operators apply\r\n#    coherent BGP policies.\r\n\r\nADD HERE:\r\n\r\nand apply recommended security measures to protect the operation of BGP\r\nprotocol on their BGP-speaking routers.\r\n\r\n# 4.1.  BGP Network Layer Protection\r\n# \r\n#    To protect a BGP speaker on the network layer, the ability to connect\r\n#    to TCP port 179 on the local device should be restricted to known\r\n#    addresses that are permitted to become a BGP neighbor.  Experience\r\n#    has shown that the natural protection TCP should offer is not always\r\n#    sufficient, as it is sometimes run in control-plane software.\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): this depends on the implementation. Cisco uses listen() calls on explicitly\r\nconfigured neighbor IP addresses only, while not allowing multiple TCP sessions\r\nbetween BGP endpoints. They had it like that from Day 0. OTOH, Juniper, relying on\r\nFreeBSD socket interface, initialy in 1998 had BGP listen on (INADDR_ANY, 179/tcp).\r\nTherefore, on Junipers, supplemental firewall filters were needed from Day 0.\r\nLater on, I think in Junos 9 or so, this was fixed, but still having firewall filters\r\nis highly recommended.\r\n\r\n# 4.2.  BGP Speaker Management Interface Protection\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): I think this whole section should be removed. At least the 1st\r\nparagraph. Or you can remove the story about VRFs and just keep the reference to\r\n[RFC6192]. The reason is that the management traffic story is quite complex, in the\r\nway that it really requires a new RFC. Seriously. :-)\r\n\r\nThe full taxonomy of routing contexts used for network management can be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Out-of-Band (OOB) Management - routers have a dedicated interface for mgmt traffic.\r\n2. In-band (IB) Management - mgmt traffic uses normal, revenue interfaces.\r\n3. BOTH - combined (e.g. IB as the default method, OOB as a backup - yes, nightmare!)\r\n\r\nAnd then, each of the above has two flavors:\r\n\r\nA) Management traffic in the default routing context (a.k.a. \"GRT context\"), or:\r\nB) Management traffic in a separate routing context (a.k.a. \"Management VRF\"):\r\n   (i)  Mgmt VRF signaled automatically outside the routers (e.g. MPLS L3 VPN), or:\r\n   (ii) Mgmt VRF local-only to the router (e.g. VRF-Lite, Virtual Router)\r\n\r\nSo, you have 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B ... plus 2 sub-flavors of the B-option (i, ii).\r\nNot all vendors can do all of those.\r\n\r\n# 5.1.1.  Integrity Verification and Authentication\r\n# \r\n#    MD5 protection of the TCP session header, described in [RFC5925], was\r\n#    the first available mechanism to protect the integrity of a BGP\r\n#    session.  It has been obsoleted by the TCP Authentication Option\r\n#    (TCP-AO; [RFC5925]), which offers stronger protection.  While MD5 is\r\n#    still the most used mechanism due to its availability in vendors'\r\n#    equipment, TCP-AO SHOULD be preferred when implemented by both sides\r\n#    of a session.\r\n\r\nADD TEXT: Optionally, if TCP-AO is not supported, while both sides of the BGP\r\nsession can support a stronger authentication algorithm than MD5, such as\r\nSHA-1 or SHA-256, using the stronger method SHOULD be considered. Aside of that,\r\nusing keychain-based cryptographic keys lifecycle management, as suggested in\r\n[RFC6518], is highly RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\n#    The drawback of TCP session protection is additional configuration\r\n#    and management overhead for the maintenance of authentication\r\n#    information (for example, MD5 passwords).  Protection of TCP sessions\r\n#    used by BGP hence MAY be enabled even when BGP sessions are\r\n#    established over shared networks where spoofing can be done (like\r\n#    IXPs), but operators are RECOMMENDED to consider the trade-offs and\r\n#    to apply TCP session protection where appropriate.\r\n\r\nREWRITE:\r\n\r\nThe drawback of TCP session protection is additional configuration and management overhead for the\r\nmaintenance of authentication information (for example, MD5 passwords). In either case, protection\r\nof TCP sessions used by BGP MUST be enabled when BGP sessions are established over shared networks\r\nwhere risk of spoofing is high (like IXPs). Operators are RECOMMENDED to consider the trade-offs\r\nand apply BGP session protection on all other external BGP sessions as well.\r\n\r\nAside of this, most vendors use simple, reverse-decryptable password hash algorithm to store\r\nshared secret keys for BGP (and other routing protocols) in the device configuration files. While\r\nthis practice simplifies password management tasks, since the passwords can always easily be\r\ndeciphered, a risk of information leak, by incidental sharing of router configuration snippets,\r\nis high. Some vendors have an option to protect those passwords using a stronger altorithm, with\r\nthe option to show cleartext passwords upon entering a master key. Using such mechanisms, where\r\npossible, is highly RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\n#    Furthermore, operators SHOULD block spoofed packets (packets with a\r\n#    source IP address not belonging to their IP address space) at all\r\n#    edges of their network (see [RFC2827] and [RFC3704] ).  This protects\r\n#    the TCP session used by Internal BGP (iBGP) from attackers outside\r\n#    the Autonomous System.  Similarly, the considerations for using non\r\n#    globally reachable addresses for links handling BGP sessions from\r\n#    Section 4.1 apply accordingly.\r\n\r\nADD:\r\n\r\nAside of that, as an additional security measure, iBGP sessions SHOULD also be protected using\r\nthe authentication mechanisms discussed above.\r\n\r\n# 5.1.2.  Defending Against PMTUD Related Attacks\r\n# \r\n#    In 2018 an attack on BGP was described in the literature which claims\r\n#    to enable BGP route injection without Layer 2 adjacency by leveraging\r\n#    PMTUD, see ([FENG-22]).  The attack leverages packet fragmentation to\r\n#    bypass standard TCP protection mechanisms, so routes can be injected\r\n#    into an established BGP session.  While the attack would be mitigated\r\n#    by the integrity mechanisms suggested in Section 5.1.1, operators\r\n#    SHOULD additionally take precautions to defend against these attacks,\r\n#    especially if authentication mechanisms are not in use.  To mitigate\r\n#    this attack, BGP speakers should not allow packet fragmentation on\r\n#    the control plane for BGP traffic between themselves and their\r\n#    neighbors.  This is feasible, as even on multi-hop sessions, the path\r\n#    MTU should be known to the operators, meaning that it can be\r\n#    statically and consistently configured for both speakers involved in\r\n#    a session to prevent the need for fragmentation.  Hence, operators\r\n#    SHOULD ensure that fragmentation is neither allowed nor necessary for\r\n#    BGP packets between two BGP speakers.  If this is not possible, a\r\n#    strict lower limit for the MTU SHOULD be configured.  Given that IPv6\r\n#    requires an MTU of at least 1280b, this value is the RECOMMENDED\r\n#    minimum.\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): actually, it's not MTU, it's MSS. This feature is well-known\r\nas \"TCP MSS Clamping\". MSS is calculated as:\r\n\r\ntcp.mss = (ip.mtu - 40) if (ip.version == 4) else (ip.mtu - 60)\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\nhttps://bgp.tools/kb/understanding-tcp-mss\r\n\r\n# 7.  Dynamic Prefix Filtering\r\n# \r\n#    In this section, we discuss dynamic prefix filters, i.e., filters\r\n#    that decide whether a prefix should be im- or exported or not based\r\n#    on frequently changing parameters and external resources.\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): Maybe at this point of text you should already provide a short\r\nreference to 7.2, where ROV/RPKI is discussed. Just to say something like:\r\n\r\n\"Using Route Origin Validation (ROV), wherever possible, SHOULD be preferred over\r\nusing IRR information. ROV is discussed in Chapter 7.2.\r\n\r\n# 7.1.3.  Recursively Computing Filters\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): With the new version of IRRd, that will soon become used by\r\nall major IRRs, the need for recursion will become obsolete. Even now, IRRd offers\r\na simple query to grab prefixes from AS-SETs (!i, !g). Also, I'm not sure whether\r\nto refer to [bgpq4] - the tool might not exist in the future, especially having in\r\nmind that IRRd v4 has a JSON-based interface, which makes things much easier to\r\ngrab from IRRs.\r\n\r\nYou might want to get in touch with NTT guys & girls that maintain IRRd (they\r\npresented on RIPE87).\r\n\r\n# 7.3.  Inbound Filtering Prefixes Belonging to the Local AS\r\n\r\nREMARK (AUTHOR ONLY): This depends on the neighbor roles - whether they are customers,\r\npeers, transits. This section requires a bit of rework too. Or a reference to Chapter\r\n7.5.1 where BGP roles are discussed.\r\n\r\n# 7.6.2.  Prefixes on Routers Connected to an IXP\r\n# \r\n#    It is suggested (see also [APNICTRN-17]), that operators dedicate\r\n#    routers for connections to an IXP that SHOULD only carry routes from\r\n#    the ASes cone, and not a full-table or default-route.  This reduces\r\n#    the chance of accidental route leaks and prevents other IXP members\r\n#    from pointing default routes via the IXP LAN to such a router.\r\n\r\nADD TEXT: alternatively, using a separate routing context (e.g. VRF) for IXP peerings,\r\ncontaining only routes form the local AS cone, is a good option too.\r\n\r\n# 8.3.  AS Path Filtering\r\n\r\nTITLE CHANGE: AS_PATH Filtering\r\n\r\nREMARK: AS_PATH is being used in [RFC4271] as the official abbreviation of that attribute.\r\n\r\nADD THE FOLLOWING AT THE END OF THIS CHAPTER - with the following text:\r\n\r\nSome BGP implementations offer various advanced AS_PATH manipulation features, such as overriding or rewriting a part of the AS_PATH.\r\nFor instance, a very commonly used mechanism is the so-called \"AS Override\" feature, primarily intended for use in MPLS L3 VPNs,\r\nwhere the customer's AS number is overriden with the provider's AS number, to allow site-to-site communication where both customer\r\nsites use the  same AS number. Some vendors went even further, offering a possibility to fully rewrite or even delete the AS_PATH\r\nAttribute from the incoming our outgoing BGP Update messages. In principle, use of any AS_PATH modification mechanism except\r\nAS_PATH prepend in the public Internet SHOULD be avoided at all! Also, as discussed already, AS_PATH prepend SHOULD NOT be too\r\nexcessive. The \"AS Override\" feature MAY still be used in closed environments, such as VPNs not directly exchanging any NLRIs with\r\nthe Internet. AS_PATH rewriting/deleting SHOULD be avoided.\r\n\r\n# 8.5.  BGP Community Scrubbing\r\n\r\nADD TEXT: Extended BGP communities received from other ASNs SHOULD in principle be scrubbed. In the outbound direction,\r\nExtended BGP communities SHOULD be scrubbed.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION (AUTHOR ONLY): when BGP routes are enclosed in an MPLS VRF, some vendors send route-target communities along\r\nwith advertisements to the external parties, that are treated as CE routers. While this may be useful in some cases\r\n(e.g. [RFC4364] - Inter-AS VPN Option B), using those communities in the Internet peering context is NOT RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 8.6.  BGP Attribute Scrubbing\r\n# \r\n#    Over the past years several instances of network disruptions due to\r\n#    routers being unable to process specific BGP attributes were\r\n#    encountered.  As such, operators MAY opt to scrub all BGP attributes\r\n#    known to cause service disruptions on their infrastructure.\r\n# \r\n\r\nADD TEXT:\r\n\r\nWhile being a very useful tool, BGP attribute scrubbing features MAY cause undesired effects and sometimes even large-scale outages.\r\nTherefore, this needs to be used with extreme care and treated as a last-resort temporary workaround - not a permanent solution.\r\nThis configuration SHOULD be removed when the problem, causing it to be introduced, is solved by a more stable means - e.g. by\r\nhardware and/or software replacement or upgrade. Besides, Mandatory BGP attributes and Optional Attributes commonly used in the\r\nInternet, such as AS_PATH, Communities, MED and so on MUST NOT be scrubbed ever!\r\n\r\nNEW CHAPTER:\r\n\r\n8.7. BGP Attribute Header Correction\r\n\r\nBGP attributes are stored within BGP UPDATE messages as a vector of Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields, while the Attribute Type field\r\ncontains a set of control bits, such as Optional Bit (set to 1 for Optional Attributes and 0 for Well-Known), Transitive Bit\r\n(specifying whether the attribute is Transitive - i.e. propagated outside the local AS or Non-Transitive - the opposite) and so on.\r\nWhile [RFC4271] mandates that the BGP speaker, receiving even a single UPDATE message containing a malformed combination of\r\nAttribute TLV headers, tears the BGP session down immediately, [RFC7606] allows the BGP implementors to optionally add various\r\nfeatures to the code, providing self-correction of malformed attributes in a limited number of cases.\r\n\r\nWherever possible, self-correcting mechanisms for BGP Attribute TLV headers SHOULD be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 9.1.1.  Order of Prefixfilters\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL: Chapter 9.1.1 should become 9.1.2. And the new Chapter 9.1.1, preceding 9.1.2, should be:\r\n\r\n9.1.1. Implicit Policies and Default Behavior\r\n\r\nAlmost all BGP implementations have a default, implicit all-permissive export/import behavior for BGP sessions, when no specific\r\nrouting policies are configured on the router. In other words, when a BGP session is configured without any explicit import and\r\nexport policy, BGP neighbors will send and accept any and all route announcements exchanged between them. Some vendors decided to\r\ndo exactly the opposite, having an implicit all-restrictive export/import behavior, denying NLRI exchange by default if no\r\nexplicit export/import policies are conofigured. While [RFC8212] finally standardized the default behavior of to be all-restrictive,\r\ndenying advertisements and acceptance of routes when no import/export policies are configured, many vendors kept their traditional\r\nimplicit behavior as-is.\r\n\r\nHaving in mind that most large networks nowadays are multi-vendor environments, while network owners very often change their\r\npreferred eqiupment vendors and suppliers, relying on vendor-specific implicit behavior is a bad idea. What one vendor allows by\r\ndefault, the other one precisely denies. Therefore, it is always RECOMMENDED to create an explicit import and\r\nexport policy on the BGP session, even if it is simple one, having a single, unconditional all-permissive rule. Aside of making\r\nthe router configuration clean, such a practice helps simplifying automation of router configurations, especially when migrating\r\nthe functionality of the router from one vendor to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Chapter 9 - Chapter 9.1.2 (existing 9.1.1)\r\n\r\n#    Most vendors apply filters and changes (route maps, prefix filters,\r\n#    and other actions) to imported and exported NLRIs following a pre-\r\n#    defined sequence, while allowing redirection to other rules.\r\n\r\nREMARK - replace by the following:\r\n\r\nBGP is a policy-based routing protocol. [RFC4272] - 9.1 assumes the existence of export/import routing policies, controlling\r\nadvertisement/acceptance of NLRI. And [RFC8212] standardizes the all-denying behavior of BGP sessions where no explicit\r\nimport/export policies are configured. Most vendors implement import/export policies in a myriad of ways - from very basic\r\nprefix-based or AS_PATH-based filters, up to complex IF-THEN-like policy structures (typical names are: \"route maps\", \"route\r\npolicies\", \"policy statements\").\r\n\r\nRegardless of their complexities, all BGP policies consist of one or more rule sets, that are executed in a sequence, one\r\nafter another. The first rule set will scan the complete content of Adj-RIBs-in or Adj-RIBs-out; NLRIs matching the conditions\r\nof that rule set will be considered for further checks by the subsequent rule sets, while prefixes being denied will simply\r\nbe discarded. Therefore, each subsequent rule set should deal with a smaller subset of NLRIs than the previous ones. However,\r\nif the first rule set does not discard any prefix, the next rule set will scan the full content of the BGP routing tables again.\r\n```",
